# AMULOG (A Manager for Unstructured LOGs)

## Overview

A system log management tool.
The main function is to classify log messages based
on their log templates (formats and variable locations),
and to store the data in a database.

This project was partially ported from repository LogCausalAnaysis.
(https://github.com/cpflat/LogCausalAnalysis)

This system works on python3.
There are some outdated functions because of library problems.
(like MySQL, CRF-based template generation)
These are planned to be added soon.
